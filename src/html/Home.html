    <h5>Politics or Logic</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Language</strong>
        Human language operates in two realms: the real and the abstract. Politics exploits this by creating an
        illogical
        system based on belief and opinion rather than reality. The manipulation of abstract words and ideas which lack
        any scientific or logical
        foundation is the
        art of politics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Voting for Nobody</strong>
        To challenge the political system, actively vote for nobody. By marking your ballot
        with "No
        Politicians" or "FreeVote.uk" you cast a vote against politics. This vote is recorded as a spoilt
        ballot, showing clear dissent against the political system. If and when "no politicians" gains majority
        support, it
        signifies a collective demand for change.

        <strong>Politics in Disguise</strong>
        Economics is inherently political, not logical. Economics has no scientific or logical foundation, prioritising
        profit and power over society
        and the ecosystem. This political nonsense is directly leading to the destruction of the very environment our
        species relies on for survival.
        Technology has moved on due to science but our lives are clearly poorer than they were only 30 years ago.
        Economics is causing rapid social and environmental decline.
        When science already knows we consume over twice what the ecosystem can sustain, what planet do
        politicians live on to be promoting their political nonsense of economic growth?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A Sustainable Future</strong>
        To truly progress, we must reject politics and embrace science and logic. We must transform education to be
        scientific and logical, not
        political, focusing on building societies that allow everyone to enjoy life whilst nurturing the ecosystem. By
        voting for nobody, you help the migration towards a logical and sustainable society. We can return to
        enjoyinging
        nature, witnessing birdsong not traffic noise once again, as we did when economic nonsense was put on hold
        during the pandemic.
        In the 21st century, it is ridiculous that politically-whipped "representatives" vote in place of people. We can
        design 21st-century
        systems which ensure every voice is heard and carefully considered.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Voting for nobody isn't about apathy; it's about actively rejecting a corrupt and
        illogical system
        and pushing for meaningful change.</p>
    <p>Once we rid ourselves of the ridiculous kindergarten debates, we can turn our
        wonderful
        historic buildings over to genuine democracy. The House of Commons can become a day out for those in the public
        who
        would like to celebrate history by debating pressing social or environmental issues. The House of Lords can be
        similar, perhaps a place for scientists to reflect on and consider the Commons debates. Clearly, everyone must
        have a
        voice (via easy to use technology),
        so these are more theatre than democracy â€” but it will be fun and informative theatre, not boring
        and divisive politics.
