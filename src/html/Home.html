        <strong>Vote for Logic</strong>
        To change the political system, actively vote for nobody. By marking your ballot
        with "Logic not Politics" you cast a vote against politics. Your vote is recorded as a spoilt
        ballot, a vote against the political system. If and when <b>Logic not Politics</b> gains majority
        support, it signifies a collective demand for change.

        <strong>Language</strong>
        Human language operates in two realms: the real and the abstract. Politics exploits abstract by creating an
        illogical system based on belief and opinion rather than reality. The manipulation of power using abstract words
        is the art of politics. For a detailed scientific explanation of the difference
        between politics and logic see ResearchGate <a

        <strong>Politics in Disguise</strong>
        Economics is inherently political, not logical. Economics has no scientific foundation, prioritising
        power and profit over society
        and the ecosystem. This is directly leading to the destruction of the very environment our
        species relies on for survival. Economics is causing rapid social and environmental damage.
        Technology has moved on due to science but society and the ecosystem is clearly poorer than it was only 30 years
        ago.
        What planet do politicians live on to be promoting economic growth, when science already knows we consume over
        twice what the ecosystem can sustain?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A Sustainable Future</strong>
        To truly progress, we must reject politics and embrace science and logic. We must transform education to be
        scientific and logical, not
        political, enabling everyone to learn to enjoy life whilst nurturing the
        ecosystem. By
        voting for nobody, you help the migration towards a logical and sustainable society. We can return to
        enjoying nature, witnessing birdsong not traffic noise once again, as we did when economics was put on hold
        during the pandemic.
        In the 21st century, it is ridiculous that politically-whipped <i>representatives</i> vote in place of
        individuals. We can
        design 21st-century
        systems which ensure every voice is heard and carefully considered.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Voting for nobody isn't about apathy; it's about actively rejecting a corrupt and
        illogical system
        and pushing for meaningful change.</p>
    <p>Once we rid ourselves of politics, we can turn our
        wonderful
        historic buildings over to genuine democracy. The House of Commons can become a day out for those in the public
        who
        would like to celebrate history by debating pressing social or environmental issues. The House of Lords can be
        similar, perhaps a place for scientists to reflect on and consider the Commons debates. Clearly, everyone must
        have a
        voice (via secure and easy to use technology),
        so these are more theatre than democracy â€” but it will be fun and informative theatre, not boring
        and divisive politics.
